# Fuzzy Logic Applications

This repository contains implementations of various fuzzy logic applications in Python and C++. Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool for handling uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making processes.

## Introduction

In today's world, where precise data is not always available or reliable, fuzzy logic offers a flexible framework to model and manage complexity and uncertainty. Unlike classical binary logic, which strictly defines truth as either 1 or 0, fuzzy logic allows for degrees of truth between 0 and 1. This capability makes it suitable for various applications where decisions are based on vague or ambiguous information.

## Applications

The applications covered in this repository include:

- A Prerequisite for The Oral Exam - Tehcnics of Programming
- Quantum State Classification
- Computer System Performance Classification
- Network Congestion Classification
- Strategic Video Game Aggression Determination
- Dynamic Vehicle Speed Adjustment based on Road Conditions

Each application demonstrates how fuzzy logic can be applied to solve real-world problems across different domains.
